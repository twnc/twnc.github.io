<h1>2. &quot;Hello World&quot;</h1>
<hr />
<h2>SOURCE CODE</h2>
<pre><code>#include&lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

//This program prints &quot;Hello World!&quot;
int main()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>CODE OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>This program will gives as output the phrase &quot;Hello World!&quot;. Here the various parts of this program will be explained.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>At the beginning of a C++ program, you start by including libraries and header files. This is done by writing a hashtag and then the name of the standard library surrounded by a less than and an equal sign or speech marks if it is a header file. In the Hello World program include the library iostream allows us to use cout later on, a command that would otherwise have been unavailable to us.</p>
<pre><code>#include&lt;iostream&gt;
#include&quot;std\_lib\_facilities.h&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Namespaces</h3>
<p>After including any libraries you might need, you may want to set a default namespace. When typing in a command, you will have to type which namespace it belongs to.  cout is part of the standard namespace (referred to as std) so you would write <code>std::cout</code>. To save time when typing you can type <code>using namespace std;</code> which will mean that std will be assumed unless another namespace is specified. Namespaces allow you to include non standard libraries without worrying about different functions from different libraries having the same names.</p>
<pre><code>using namespace std;
</code></pre>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Comments are pieces of text that are ignored by the compiler. These allow programmers to leave notes in the code, both for themselves and for other programmers. These are incredibly useful as they allow you to clearly label the purpose of all your code which is particularly useful for large bits of code and make it much easier to quickly find what you need. There are two ways to write comments. The first is by typing // at the beginning of a line, as in the example you can see in the Hello World program. If you want to have a multiline comment however, you can start by typing /* and end it by typing */.</p>
<pre><code>//This program prints &quot;Hello World&quot;
/* This comment
   extends across
   multiple lines */
</code></pre>
<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>A function starts with an output type, then a name followed by two brackets specifying any required input. After that the contents of the function are contained within curly brackets. At the end of the contents of the function, the command return is given followed by whatever the output should be.</p>
<p>Here the only function specified is the main function. This function is called by the program start and is where the your main code should be present. At the end of the main function you should type <code>return 0</code>. This may seem odd as the program will run fine whether you write <code>return 0</code> or not but the zero allows some systems to see that the program managed to run all the way to the end.</p>
<pre><code>int main()
{
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>White Space</h3>
<pre><code>#include&lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;int main() {cout &lt;&lt;
&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;return 0;}
</code></pre>
<p>White space refers to extra spaces and line breaks. These are ignored by the compiler so the code above will compile exactly the same as the code written at the top. However doing this will make your code really hard to read, so it's highly recommended to keep to style conventions. This will make your code way easier to read and edit in the future. Style matters!</p>
<h3>cout</h3>
<p>cout is short for &quot;character out&quot; and represents the standard output stream. When you type cout you follow it with &lt;&lt; and then with the content to be sent to the standard output stream. If this content isn't a variable and you want to send some text as shown in the Hello World program, then you surround it with quotes. These quotes are not included in the output stream. The \n at the end refers to a newline.</p>
<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;
</code></pre>
<h2>COMPILING C++</h2>
<p>Before you can use your C++ program, you need to compile it. This is fairly simply done on the Mac and Linux command lines with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>g++ hello\_world.cpp -o hello\_world
</code></pre>
<p>Here the file name ending in .cpp is the source code to be converted into machine-readable code, and the file name typed after the -o flag is the name the compiled program will be given.</p>
<p>An important thing to note here are the naming conventions used with the various files.</p>
<p>hello_world.cpp - C++ Source Code (also .cc or on Linux .C is occasionally used)<br />
hello_world.c - C Source Code<br />
hello_world.o - Compiled but un linked code, also known as an object file<br />
hello_world.h - A header file (also occasionally .hh or .hpp)<br />
hello_world - An executable file</p>
<p>Avoid using spaces or special characters in your life names to save a lot of stress!</p>
<h2>ERRORS</h2>
<p>There are three types of errors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile time errors</li>
<li>Link time errors</li>
<li>Run time errors</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Compile time errors</em> have two types. The first are shown in the compiler as warnings. These are syntactically accurate and will compile, but the compiler has noticed something that is likely to be a mistake. A common example of this is mixing up = and == in an if statement. The second are showin the compiler as errors. This mean that the code is not syntactically correct and thus won't compile.</p>
<p><em>Link time errors</em> are similar to compile time errors but occur while linking files.</p>
<p><em>Run time errors</em> are the most complicated. These are often the hardest to find as the compiler can't warn you. This is usually because there is a problem in the logic of the code, so even though the code is syntactically correct, the results are not what you wanted. Another common source of run time errors come through unforeseen circumstances such as incorrect user input. Defensive programming can often be a good way to avoid these errors from the get go.</p>
<p>Don't forget to test your programs thoroughly!!!</p>
<h2>REVISION</h2>
<p><strong>Include libraries</strong> - #include &lt;iostream&gt; / using namespace std;</p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong> - for documentation /* */ //</p>
<p><strong>Function</strong> - int main();</p>
<p><strong>main()</strong> - Called at the launch of the program</p>
<p><strong>Translate and Link</strong> - g++ x.cpp -o x</p>
<p><strong>Start Program</strong> - ./x</p>
<p><strong>Naming Conventions</strong> - x.cpp x.h x.o x</p>
<p><strong>Error Categories</strong> - compile time, link time, run time</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong> - No proof of correctness but indispensible</p>
<p><strong>Style matters</strong> - Readability and maintainability</p>
