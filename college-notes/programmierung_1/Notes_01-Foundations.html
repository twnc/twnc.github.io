<h1>1. FOUNDATIONS</h1>

<h2>ALGORITHMS</h2>
<p>Algorithms can be understood as being a clearly defined and actionable set of steps use to calculate a desired value.</p>
<p>The properties of an algorithm are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input values / Output values</li>
<li>Unambiguity</li>
<li>Determinism</li>
<li>Finiteness</li>
<li>Completeness</li>
<li>Correctness</li>
</ul>
<p>There are however exceptions to this. Some programs compromise one or more of these values for pragmatic reasons. A good example of this are Las Vegas algorithms which don't always finish, but when they do they are always correct.</p>
<p>There are many methods used to depict algorithms, both graphically and textually, and these are often used during the planning process. When not writing directly in a programming language the goal is often to write your code in a less detailed manner so that you can draft it more quickly and get a clear overview.</p>
<p>There are many different ways of doing this but a short list includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Graphical Methods</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Flow Charts</li>
<li>Structograms (also known as a Nassi-Schneiderman diagram)</li>
<li>UML Diagrams (Unified Modelling Language)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Textual Methods</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Pseudocode (based on programming languages)</li>
<li>Stylised Prose</li>
<li>Programming Languages</li>
</ul>
<h2>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h2>
<p>A programming language is a language with strict formal syntax and vocabulary used in the formation of programs. It's purpose is to create a method of describing algorithms in such way that allows for humans to understand them while simultaneously allowing for automatic conversion into executable machine code.</p>
<p>There are two main types of code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source Code : Code written in a programming language</li>
<li>Machine Code : Code written in zeros and ones that can be executed by a computer (this is usually converted from source code)</li>
</ul>
<p>Converting Source Code into Machine Code is a process called <em>compiling</em> and that the program that does this is called a compiler. There are however alternatives to this. The most common being a program called a compiler which interprets and carries out the code bit by bit (often line by line). Some programming languages are best suited for compiling while others work better with interpreters.</p>
<p>When compiling most programs don't have the entire program text translated to machine at once. Commonly used parts of programs (such as I/O functionality) will often be stored in libraries where precompiled versions are kept available. These compiled bits of codes are the joined together by a program called a <em>linker</em>.</p>
<p>An alternative to this is a dynamic link library where the compiled parts are linked only when the program is run.</p>
<h2>PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</h2>
<p>Different paradigms often suit different sorts of programming and thus different languages often have very different structures. Some of the following will be listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imperative
<ul>
<li>Procedural
<ul>
<li>C++</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Declarative
<ul>
<li>Functional
<ul>
<li>Lisp</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Logic-oriented
<ul>
<li>Prolog</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Logic-oriented programming</em> comprises of a set of rules and a list of facts. You can then make requests based on this information. For example a program with the rule <code>When it rains, you get wet</code> and the fact <code>It is raining</code> could be asked if you're wet. And given the rules and the information that it has will answer positively. Obviously this is a very simple example but this is the fundamental principle.</p>
<p><em>Functional programming</em> is made up of functions that are built up in a mathematical way. Each occurence of a function can be replaced by its result. This means that functions don't have any side effects as there are no variables.</p>
<p><em>Imperative Programming</em> is made up of a series of instructions. These instructions can save, read and edit variables.</p>
<p>There are many other types of programming such as sequential vs parallel, typed versus non typed, and object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>C++ is classified as an <em>imperative, procedural language</em>. This means that it assigns values to variables and that these variables can be reassigned new values and that it is made up of a list of instructions.</p>
<p>It can also be described as a <em>sequential language</em> which means that it's instructions are carried out in the order that they are written.</p>
<p>And finally C++ is also a <em>strongly typed language</em>. This means that variables have a predetermined set of possible values that allow for different sorts of operations such as int, double or string.</p>
<h2>STRUCTURED PROGRAM THEOREM</h2>
<p>Any computable function can be carried out with the following three programming constructs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sequence</li>
<li>Decision</li>
<li>Iteration</li>
</ol>
<p>This theorem is credited to BÃ¶hm and Jacopini.</p>
